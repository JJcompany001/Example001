    <h1>CSS3</h1>
  <p style="margin-top:20px;"><strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.[1]
    CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2</p>
    <p style="margin-top:20px;"><strong>CSS</strong> is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .
      css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>
