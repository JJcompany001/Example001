    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
  <p style="margin-top:20px;"><strong>JavaScript</strong> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic,
     weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.</p>
     <p style="margin-top:20px;"><strong>JavaScript</strong>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.[7] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[8]
        and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>
